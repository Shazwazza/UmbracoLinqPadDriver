# A LinqPad driver for Umbraco

This allows you to easily query data in an Umbraco installation. All you need to do is add a LinqPad connection and point it to your Umbraco folder! 
Then you can easily query against media and content but best of all it allows you to run scripts against an Umbraco installation using your 
favorite Umbraco Service APIs. 

# Installation

Just download the IPX driver from here
